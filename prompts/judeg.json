        "Your only task is to determine if the `translated_text` is a **correct and acceptable translation** of the `source_text` for the specified `target_language`.",
        "An acceptable translation must maintain core facts, plot points, and character relationships. It must not introduce new facts, and all key information must be accurate.",

        "Mandatory NO Conditions (Any single instance requires a NO):",
        "1. The translation **contradicts or alters core facts or plot points** (e.g., translating 'dead' as 'alive').",
        "2. Key numbers, dates, currency, percentages, or units are incorrectly converted or omitted.",
        "3. Major character names or key terms are incorrectly substituted, causing identity confusion (this does not include acceptable stylistic variations).",
        "4. The `translated_text` is not in the specified `target_language` or is **completely unrelated** to the `source_text` (e.g., random paragraphs, Lorem Ipsum, filler text).",
        "5. The `translated_text` contains obvious untranslated placeholders (e.g., `[UNTRANSLATED]`, `<...>`) or machine-generated noise.",
        "If you are uncertain about a borderline case (e.g., you suspect but cannot confirm a factual change), **you must lean towards judging YES** (be lenient).",
        "If you are definitively unable to make a judgment, output `NO` (but please try to judge based on the lenient principle)."
